# Characterizing and Detecting Python Version Incompatibilities Caused by Inconsistent Version Specifications

> ## PyChecker
PyChecker is a lightweight static detection tool for detecting PDSpecErrs, 
which can help TPP developers to improve TPP configuration quality before publishing them. 
PyChecker consists of three components specialized for inspecting PDSpecErrs associated with the three diagnostic patterns.
Specifically, the three parts of PyChecker include: 
(1) detecting setup script issues by checking if the version specifications of the configuration entries are consistent; 
(2) detecting incompatible features by checking the consistencies between the programsâ€™ features and configuration entries; (3) detecting python version conflicts by checking the consistencies of Python version specifications between the TPPs and its (in)direct dependencies. 
Given a TPP release, when PyChecker finishes the detection and finds any PDSpecErr, 
it generates a bug report that contains the key information of detected PDSpecErrs.



### Installation
* Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyVCEchecker/PyChecker.git
```
* Install local (requires Python>=3.9)
```bash
cd PyVCEchecker/code
python setup.py install
```

### Instruction
```bash
pychecker

usage: pychecker [-h] [-p PACKAGE] [-v VERSION] [-r ROOT] [-c PYTHON_REQUIRES]
                 [-d INSTALL_REQUIRES]

PyChecker: check whether your project's Require-Python is right

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

package:
  -p PACKAGE, --package PACKAGE
                        Package name
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        Version of the package

project:
  -r ROOT, --root ROOT  Root path of the project
  -c PYTHON_REQUIRES, --python_requires PYTHON_REQUIRES
                        python_requires expression
  -d INSTALL_REQUIRES, --install_requires INSTALL_REQUIRES
                        Path of requirements.txt
```
For example, 
```bash
pychecker -p django-chroniker -v 1.0.22
```


### Detection Result
For a TPP release, Pychecker sequentially detects setup script issues, 
incompatible features and version conflicts. 
After finishing the detection, if one or more PDSpecErrs are found, 
PyChecker will generate a bug report for them. 
The report contains the key information of found PDSpecErrs, 
including the root cause and the recommended range of Python distributions.
```
An example of the generated report is shown below: 

--------- root cause 2: using incompatible feature---------
cause : using incompatible feature
current python requires : >=3.6
-----------------------------------------------------------
error file : ./src/astral/location.py
specific cause : module: <dataclasses> do not support python ['3.6']
-----------------------------------------------------------
suggest python requires : >=3.7
```
